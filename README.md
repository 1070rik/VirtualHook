VirtualHook
-----------

## Introduction 

VirtualHook is a tool for hooking application without root permission. It is based on two projects:

- [VirtualApp](https://github.com/asLody/VirtualApp). It's a plugin framework which allows running applications in its virtual space.
- [YAHFA](https://github.com/rk700/YAHFA). It's a hook framework for ART which allows hooking Java method of the application.

Currently VirtualHook supports:

- Android 5.0(API 21)
- Android 5.1(API 22)
- Android 6.0(API 23)
- __EXPERIMENTAL__ Android 7.0(API 24)
- __EXPERIMENTAL__ Android 7.1(API 25)

## Build

(__ATTENTION__: Hook may fail if the target method is compiled to be inlined. However, such optimization would not apply to debuggable application. Therefore, please make sure that the __VirtualHook app is built with debuggable option on__.)

Import and build the project in Android Studio(__with Instant Run disabled__). There are four modules:

- `app`. This is the VirtualApp application module.
- `lib`. This is the VirtualApp library module.
- `YAHFA`. This is the YAHFA hook module.
- `demoHookPlugin`. This is a demo hook plugin which compiles to an APK.

After building the APKs, push the `demoHookPlugin` APK to device at `/sdcard/io.virtualhook/patch.apk` and run the main application. The hook plugin would be applied to all applications running in VirtualApp.

Please refer to [demoHookPlugin](https://github.com/rk700/VirtualHook/tree/master/VirtualApp/demoHookPlugin) for more details.
